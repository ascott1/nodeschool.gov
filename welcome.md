# nodeschool.gov

Welcome and thank you for signing up for nodeschool.gov. To make this NodeSchool the best NodeSchool, there are a few things that you can do before you arrive to be ready to excel!

## Steps to get ready for NodeSchool

1. Install Node.js - This can be done by choosing the pre-built installers [here](http://nodejs.org/download/).
2. After you've installed Node.js, install the NodeSchool workshops (see below).
3. Come ready to learn with your favorite text editing program (We suggest [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2), [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Brackets](http://brackets.io/))

## What is NodeSchool?

NodeSchool is a collection of open-source workshops that teach web software skills. It originated as a way to get up to speed with Node.js, but has expanded to help you learn multiple topics. NodeSchool has 3 main packages that should help get you up to speed in Node. These packages are:

* javascripting `$npm install -g javascripting`
    * Learn the basics of JavaScript. No previous programming experience required.
* git-it `npm install -g git-it`
    * Learn Git and GitHub basics.
* learnyounode `$npm install -g learnyounode`
    * Learn the basics of node: asynchronous i/o, http.
* stream-adventures `$npm install -g stream-adventure`
    * Learn to compose streaming interfaces with .pipe().

There are also a whole bunch of electives, but if you are comfortable with the 3 main packages you should sign up to [help us mentor](https://ti.to/gov/nodeschool)! The complete list of NodeSchool packages can be found [here](http://nodeschool.io/index.html#workshopper-list).

## Additional info

The event will have about an hour of installing and diving into the various workshops, and then another hour or two of time to meet other attendees and consume refreshments. The best part of doing nodeschool events in person is creating real-world connections.

If you have finished some of the nodeschool workshops already then you should consider mentoring. Sign up as a mentor to attend and help others get through their first few challenges. You can also attend and hack on new workshops -- the workshop software itself is open source.

NodeSchool strives to be a welcoming and safe event for all attendees. Attendees should follow the our [code of conduct](https://github.com/ascott1/nodeschool.gov/blob/master/conduct.md).
